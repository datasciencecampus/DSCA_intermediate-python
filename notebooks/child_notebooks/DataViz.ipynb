    "### 1. Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "'Matplotlib' is python's core plotting library. If you want to produce graphical summaries of data it is a good place to start, as simple graphs can be created relatively quickly. Matplotlib is also a really useful library to understand basic plotting functionality in general, understanding some matplotlib will really help you out even if you ultimately end up using one of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* seaborn - makes basic matplotlib plotting look nice, and adds some more advanced plot types, like violin plots, strip plots, kde plots etc. Open-source.\n",
    "* bokeh - interactive visualisation for web. Open source.\n",
    "* plotnine - a port of R's established ggplot2 library. Open-source.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when using matplotlib, you go through the following process:\n",
    "1. Create a figure with one or more axes, each axis is effectively a blank canvas.\n",
    "2. Plot some data onto the axes using one or more graph types.\n",
    "3. Decorate and adjust the visual aspects of the plot (e.g. labels, ticks, titles etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will become clearer as you learn how to make plots!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",

    "Working with matplotlib requires at least a vague understand of the main objects that matplotlib uses to make plots: figure and axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `Figure` object\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Figure` object is the outermost container for a plot. A simple `Figure` contains one `Axes` object, but can contain multiple `Axes` objects. In addition, the `Figure` also contains and manages other objects associated with plot (e.g. titles, legends etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `Axes` object\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Axes` object is effectively the plot itself and is the main thing you work with when creating a plot. An `Axes` is composed of many objects which can be used to define what is actually represented in the plot. There are a large number of `Axes` methods that allow you to create particular types of plot, like line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots and so on. In addition, many of the objects that comprise an `Axes` can be set from the `Axes` object, the axis labels, ticks, ranges and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other matplotlib objects\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also see references to `Axis` objects which sit inside `Axes` and set graph limits and ticks, `Locator` objects which set tick locations, `Formatter` objects which format labels, as well as the more generic `Artist` object from which all kinds of useful objects like `Line2D`, `Patch` etc. derive. Although you can interact with all these matplotlib objects to tailor an output, most of the time you can do everything you need through the `Axes` object."

    "When we make plots, we're not going to call `plt` directly, although this is possible. Instead we will create an axis object that we can then manipulate. This will approach ultimately prove *really* useful, particularly when you come to style your plot or make figures with multiple axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using `plt.subplots()`\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",

    "```\n",
    "Setting nrows and ncols to values > 1 creates multiple axes in a grid formation. These axes can be further customised using the [gridspec](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/intermediate/gridspec.html) module, but that is a more advanced undertaking.\n",
